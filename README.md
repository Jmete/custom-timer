# Meeting Timer app

I created a minimalist timer that is better for developers that uses JSON to store meeting templates to allow for hot swapping between different meeting structures by just editing text files that I can maintain.

The timer largely is built using React for smooth client-side actions.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
